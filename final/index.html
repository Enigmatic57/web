    <h2>In this short lesson, you will learn the main lines to the Pirc Defense.</h2>
    <div class = "myclass">
        <p class = "myclass">This opening for black can be consistently played against 1. e4. This play by white is the most common as it can lead to a powerful center control. White aims to control the opening tempo, constantly making black respond to white's moves. However, the concept behind the Pirc defense is to allow white to gain initial center control while black creates a powerful defense. After bringing the bishop to a fianchetto and castling, black can strike the opposing center with c5 at any time. Personally, the most important benefit of the Pirc is straying from the typical knight and bishop opening that follows 1. e5. As many intermediate players haven't studied the Pirc Defense, knowing the lines creates tactical positions difficult to counter for white. Not only is this opening incredibly strong for intermediate players searching for a staple opening, not a single memorized line can counter it in higher level games. Still, it offers traps that can win material for black when against easier opponents. Top level chess players like Carlsen have played this opening to this date to win in world championships.
